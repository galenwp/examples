# Urbit - Examples

This repository contains some example code for Urbit. There are generators (short `:dojo` commands), libraries (to be loaded into `:dojo`), `%ford` web examples, `%gall` applications, and marks and structures that these example `%gall` applications use.

> We've found it also helps to have a clone of the docs on hand in case `urbit.org` experiences high traffic. You can copy these into your running urbit as well and self-host them locally.
>
> In your Unix shell, clone our [docs repo](https://github.com/urbit/docs) somewhere and copy the contents from your `/docs/path` into your `%examples` desk's `web` directory:
>
> ```
> cp -r /docs/path/docs* /urbit/path/your-urbit/examples/web
> ```
>
> And view them locally from the browser at:
>
> ```
> http://localhost:8443/~~/docs
> ```

Give us feedback in [`:talk`](https://urbit.org/~~/stream) or [file a Github issue](https://github.com/urbit/examples/issues) if you have any ideas, requests, or problems. Pull requests and comments are more than welcome!

We'd love if this became a project driven by the Urbit open-source community. Contribute, ask lots of questions and build stuff in Hoon to show off to the world!
