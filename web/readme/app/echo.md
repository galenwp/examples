# `:echo`

This app demonstrates how to enter input from the command line and print it out
in the `:dojo`.

To run, start the app from `:dojo`:

    ~your-urbit:dojo/examples> |start %echo

and poke the app with any noun:

    ~your-urbit:dojo/examples> :echo {insert any noun}

Here the app simply printfs the input and then returns an empty list of moves
and its app state unchanged.
