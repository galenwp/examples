# Generators

Generators are short Urbit shell scripts.

> If you're not viewing this from your urbit's web interface, follow our installation instructions [on Github](https://github.com/urbit/examples) and come back here to run these examples!

Generators live under `/gen` in a `%clay` desk, and are invoked with `+name` at the `:dojo` prompt.

We've grouped generators by section, like `hello`. To run one you'll need the directory prefix:

    ~your-urbit:dojo> +hello/h1
    'Hello, world!'

Get started by trying one of the following generators!

> XX Galen: which of the three?

#### Hello world
**Command:**  
`~your-urbit:dojo/examples> +hello/h1`

**Source**:  
`/gen/hello/h1.hoon`

#### Hello Mars
**Command:**  
`~your-urbit:dojo/examples> +hello/h2 'Mars'`

**Source**:  
`/gen/hello/h2.hoon`
